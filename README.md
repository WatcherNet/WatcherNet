## What Is DoS/DDoS Attack?

In a DDoS attack, the attacker sends a lot of information to a target. This can be done by software that commands the attacker's computer to send packets of information to the target. The information the attacker sends to the target completely takes up his/her's bandwith. 

So how does this shut down someone's internet?

When you are peforming actions on the internet such as watching a YouTube video, gaming, or surfing, the server of that website is sending you information to make that action possible. Here we will be showing you an example of packet exchange by watching a YouTube video. 

Your computer is requesting packets from YouTube's server. These packets command your computer to display some lights on the screen that make a YouTube video. Packiets take up your internet traffic and too much of them can make your internet very slow. Every packet protocol is just commands for your computer to execute and tasks. So normally when your computer gets an information packet it completes the task. When there are too many packets, the computer cannot complete all of them quickly and ends of spending all of it's own bandwith trying to complete the task. Your computer is stuck trying to complete all these tasks. 

DDoS attacks are just annoying to your average user but can be very dammaging towards companies and websites.

People believe that quality service is expected from the websites that the go on. They believe that they are secure. When websites get DDoSed they lose that trust for the company. Unlike people, their ip is not encrypted. It is just out there because if it was encrypted companies won't be able to do the things they do. DDoS attacks ro companies can result in costumer frustration, and or lack of trust.
